## Challenges
* Taking on this final project with all the requirements solo is the biggest challenge of the project.
    * Reason for going solo?  
        1. To ensure I have the confidence to face any challenges and opportunities provided as I leverage my new skills.
        2. My career has been spent working with and leading teams through projects. My successful product launches are proof of my ability to scope, schedule, work through, delegate and deliver on hardware projects ranging from technology cards to servers and datacenter solutions to programs to software management and compatibility software solutions, just to hit the highlights.
    * Wireframes!  In order to develop my Adobe XD wireframes, I had to have a solid understanding of the following:
        1.  Customer experience - this is first a sales tools for the business and secondly an administrative tool to help save time/cost of doing business
        2. How to handle booking a date and linking pages.  It is easy to have users jump to a section using HTML but moving them to another page is how React is designed.
        3.  Feature creep and uncertainty about how much work/time will be required to achieve the desired solution.  Talked to experienced coders and developers before defining the wireframes which are enough to start the framework for the backend. 
    * Resources to help through this project are critical.
        1. Having kept up with the class, completed all homework assignments provided me to practice needed to build memory muscle.
        2. Watching videos to dive deeper or broaden my understanding has proven very helpful.
            -  favorites included Scrimba, Audacity, The Net Ninja
        3.  Could use another week of tutorials and practice to become more comfortable with testing.  Hoping to include more testing but concerned with delivering critical MVP by myself.  2-3 weeks is not a lot of time to create a full business website.
        4.  Limited University of Texas resources.  50 minutes of 1x1 tutoring, 3 hours/week of office hours, 5 classes to talk through problems with my instructor and TA isn't a whole lot.  Planning questions and having enough understanding to use this time most effectively has been challenging.
        5.  Recognizing how much time is required to deliver results.  Luckily time flies when you are having fun! :smile:
